<title> <h1> history of an html. </h1> </title>
hypertext markup language (html) is a markup language used to create web pages. It was created in 1990 by sir tim berners-lee, a British computer scientist who is credited with inventing the world wide Web.[1] webpages can include writing, links, pictures, and even sound and video. html tells web browsers what webpages should look like. html also adds meta information to webpages. meta information is information about a webpage e.g., the name of the person who created the page. Web browsers usually do not show meta information.<br> html uses "elements" to let the browser know how a webpage is made of. elements are shown as "tags" in the code, written with angle brackets: <example>. tags usually come in pairs: an opening tag defines the start of a block of content and a closing tag defines the end of that block of content. there are many kinds of tags, and each one has a different purpose. see basic html tags below for tag examples.
